            <h2 id="1-preamble">1. Preamble</h2>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The state of a person‚Äôs life is the result of an accumulation of decisions.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>. The decisions that a person makes form a pattern.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>. From this pattern it is possible to derive an emergent policy of action (<strong>Action Policy</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>. An <strong>Action Policy</strong> is the ruleset by which actions are generated from beliefs about the person‚Äôs environment: <em>‚ÄúGiven X facts, make Y action‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p><strong>E</strong>. Notionally, an <strong>Action Policy</strong> is an algorithm for decision-making given incomplete knowledge about an environment (ie. an <strong>Action Policy</strong> is as an approximate algorithmic solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process).</p>

<h2 id="2-passive-amendment-to-the-action-policy">2. Passive Amendment to the Action Policy</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>. An <strong>Action Policy</strong> is subconsciously and continuously revised and updated through:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Divine Experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trauma</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>B</strong>. In general, revisions to the <strong>Action Policy</strong> stimulated by <strong>Learning</strong> and <strong>Divine Experience</strong> are edifying, and lead to greater <strong>Agency</strong> and <strong>Victory</strong>, while revisions resulting from <strong>Trauma</strong> are regressive, leading to risk-aversion and <strong>Failure</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The shrewd pupil is wary of <strong>Trauma</strong> disguised as <strong>Learning</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pupil also acknowledges that <strong>Divine Experience</strong> may be traumatic, but still be edifying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pupil knows that <strong>Unbeautiful Experience</strong> is traumatic</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C</strong>. All non-divine experience is metabolised as either <strong>Learning</strong> or <strong>Trauma</strong>, or it is <strong>Forgotten</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="3-effortful-amendment-to-the-action-policy">3. Effortful Amendment to the Action Policy</h2>
<p><strong>A</strong>. An <strong>Action Policy</strong> can also be updated effortfully, through <strong>Discipline</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>. <strong>Discipline</strong> competes with the <strong>Inertia of an Action Policy</strong>, which leaves it resistant to change. The prospect of <strong>Disciplinary Victory</strong> over <strong>Action Policy Inertia</strong> increases and decreases as a function of its cumulative past victories over <strong>Inertia</strong>, adjusted for recency.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alternately phrased, like begets like exponentially, and the effect size of <strong>Discipline</strong> is therefore causally circular, either entropically or negentropically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prolonged negative emotion, malaise, and powerlessness are the result of continued <strong>Indulgence</strong>, concessions to <strong>Inertia</strong>, and autocatalytic downturn in <strong>Agency</strong> stimulated by <strong>Failure</strong> and <strong>Defeat</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="4-the-belief-state">4. The Belief State</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>. The <strong>Belief State</strong> is a predictive model of a person‚Äôs environment, and is coterminous with a person‚Äôs beliefs and presumptions about the state of their environment.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>. Implicit in, and derivable from, the <strong>Belief State</strong>, are accurate or inaccurate <strong>Predictions</strong>, which are anticipatory fantasies about the experiences expected to follow from <strong>Actions</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The shrewd pupil will understand that the only available input to measure the accuracy of a prediction is the resulting experiences from actions taken on them. Predictions anticipate the <strong>Perceived Result</strong>, which the pupil must not mistake for the <strong>Real Result</strong>.</li>
  <li>The accuracy of a prediction is measured by the extent of <strong>Victory</strong> achieved as a result of acting upon the prediction. <strong>Total Victory</strong> is achieved by acting on totally accurate predictions. Properly conceived, <strong>Victory</strong> is the sole measure of the accuracy of a prediction, and of the appropriateness of the <strong>Belief State</strong>.</li>
  <li>Improperly conceived, predictions are accurate to the extent of their correlation with the phantasmic ‚Äòreality‚Äô, and unrelated to <strong>Victory</strong>. This conception is improper because it is circular: the phantasmic ‚Äòreality‚Äô is actually the <strong>Belief State</strong> in disguise, an internal and mutable phenomenon mistaken for an external and static one.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C</strong>. Notionally, the <strong>Real Result</strong> is comprised of the <strong>Perceived Result</strong>, reduced in proportion to <strong>Misattributed Causality</strong>, and increased in proportion to the <strong>Unperceived Results</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>(PR - MR) + UR</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>D.</strong> The <strong>Belief State</strong> is parsimoniously updated as a function of the <strong>Prediction Delta</strong>, a measurement of the difference between the <strong>Prediction</strong> and the <strong>Perceived Outcome</strong> based on discrete inferences of causal relation.</p>

<p>E. The <strong>State Transition Function</strong> is the function by which the <strong>Belief State</strong> is amended, and resists amendment. The evolution of the <strong>Belief State</strong> is determined by the <strong>State Transition Function</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="5-action-policy-arbitrage">5. Action Policy Arbitrage</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>. Notionally, the <strong>Belief State</strong> can be directly amended effortfully through <strong>Discipline</strong>, if the pupil is in a state of <strong>Ultimate Agency</strong>. Most pupils will never achieve true discipline, let alone <strong>Ultimate Agency</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>. Through <strong>Shrewd Interrogation</strong>, it is possible to backwards-engineer the priors of another person‚Äôs <strong>Action Policy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>. Through <strong>Comparative Evaluation</strong>, it is possible to identify the inferiorities of one‚Äôs own <strong>Action Policy</strong>, and the corresponding priors which underlie the inferiorities.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>. The process of amending the <strong>Action Policy</strong> is <strong>Action Policy Arbitrage</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-pupil-has-learned">The Pupil has Learned:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All non-divine experience is metabolised as either <strong>Learning</strong> or <strong>Trauma</strong>, or it is <strong>Forgotten</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pupil‚Äôs <strong>Perceived Result</strong> is easily mistaken for the <strong>Real Result</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The phantasmic ‚Äòreality‚Äô is actually the pupil‚Äôs <strong>Belief State</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Total Victory</strong> is the final measure of the accuracy of <strong>Predictions</strong> and <strong>Beliefs</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ultimate Agency</strong> is required to force amendments to the <strong>Belief State</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thusly, <strong>Ultimate Agency</strong> materialises <strong>TOTAL VICTORY</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="thusly-the-pupil-may-make-himself-holy">Thusly the Pupil May Make Himself Holy:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Observing the <strong>Belief State</strong> and <strong>Action Policy</strong> of others</li>
  <li>Amending his own <strong>Action Policy</strong> through <strong>Discipline</strong> and <strong>Action Policy Arbitrage</strong>
</li>
  <li>Controlling, limiting, or metabolising <strong>Unbeautiful Experience</strong>
</li>
  <li>Increasing openness to <strong>Divine Experience</strong> and devoting himself to <strong>Learning</strong>
</li>
  <li>Directly amending the <strong>Belief State</strong> to achieve <strong>Total Victory</strong>
</li>
</ol>

            <h2 id="markdown-basics">Markdown Basics</h2>

<p>The Exocore utilizes standardized Markdown syntax, along with some additional extensions. Much of the content of this article covers existing markdown syntax used universally in plain text formatting. However, some syntax, such as <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/writing-with-exocore-syntax#examples-of-wikilinks">wikilinks</a> and <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/writing-with-exocore-syntax#inserting-images">images</a> are particular to the Exocore.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax" class="web-link">A Simple markdown cheat sheet </a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" class="web-link">A more comprehensive markdown cheat sheet</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="headers">Headers</h2>

<p>The above is a level 2 heading, preceded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##</code> and a space.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs nothing special about the way the Exocore processes headers‚Äî it‚Äôs just standard markdown. However, each header will render with an anchor link. If you hover over a heading and click the link icon that appears, the URL in your browser will reflect the section that you clicked. Now, if you copy that URL it will link directly to the heading that you clicked.</p>

<h3 id="heading-levels">Heading levels</h3>

<p>The above is a level 3 heading, preceded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">###</code> and a space.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs some advice: Only use top-level headings (preceded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>) for the document‚Äôs title. Aside from being markdown best practice, the Exocore takes your first top-level heading to use as the title of the page in the final rendered output. For intra-document section titles, use a level 2 heading. It‚Äôs for the best.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-wikilinks">Examples of Wikilinks:</h2>

<p>Here is a basic wikilink, pointing to other posts on this Exocore: [[grudges]] It renders like this: <a class="wiki-link" href="/music/grudges">grudges</a>.</p>

<p>It is written as the title of their corresponding markdown file, surrounded by double square brackets. However, in the final render they are presented by default as the page‚Äôs title. This saves you typing out the whole page title in your markdown document, and allows the Foam VSCode extension to suggest files as you type. Below you can read about how to change their presentation.</p>

<p>You can alias a link like this: [[Fox|this link]] if you don‚Äôt want to keep the title. Heads up‚Äî <a class="wiki-link" href="/notes/fox">This link</a> points to a quote from Mishima.</p>

<p>You can also point to headers within a page: [[writing-with-exocore-syntax#Wikilink Embeds|This wikilink]]. <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/writing-with-exocore-syntax#wikilink-embeds">This wikilink</a> points to a header further down on this page, by using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>. Under that header you will find a different sort of wikilink‚Äî an embed. The content of another note is embedded within the current note. You can also point to a particular header within another note.</p>

<p>Check out the backlinks section at the bottom of any post, and you‚Äôll find a list of every post that links back to it. Backlinks are automatically generated, and display all posts with links pointing to them.</p>

<h2 id="wikilink-embeds">Wikilink Embeds</h2>

<p>The below text is embedded, using the same wikilink syntax as normal, but with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> prepended. The full text of the linked note will be included. For example, here is an example of embedded note syntax:</p>

<div class="embed-wrapper">
<div class="embed-title"></div>
<div class="embed-content">
<h1 id="to-die-among-strangers">To Die Among Strangers</h1>
<p>What I wanted was to die among strangers, untroubled, beneath a cloudless sky. And yet my desire differed from the sentiments of that ancient Greek who wanted to die under the briliant sun. What I wanted was some natural, spontaneous suicide. I wanted a death like that of a fox, not yet well versed in cunning, that walks carelessly along a mountain path and is shot by a hunter because of its own stupidity‚Ä¶</p>
<p>- Yukio Mishima</p>
</div>
<a class="embed-wiki-link" href="/notes/fox"></a>
</div>

<h2 id="external-hyperlinks">External Hyperlinks</h2>

<p>Hyperlinks to external sites are not the same as wikilinks. A wikilink is a simple way to hyperlink to other posts on your Exocore without using the full processed URL as it is rendered online. A wikilink works locally in VSCode, allowing you to navigate between posts, and is transformed at render time to a web hyperlink, so that it always points to the correct page.</p>

<p>To create a hyperlink, use single normal parentheses around the URL you want to point to, and square brackets around the text you want displayed:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis" class="web-link">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis</a></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis)</code></p>

<p>You can alias a hyperlink by changing the text in the square brackets, like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" class="web-link">Here‚Äôs some information about Hyperlinks.</a></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Here's some information about Hyperlinks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)</code></p>

<h2 id="applying-classes-to-a-paragraph-or-image">Applying classes to a paragraph or image</h2>

<p class="right-aside"><strong>Oh, by the way:</strong> You can apply the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.right-aside}</code> class to create an aside, like this one. An aside floats to one side and other text wraps around it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.left-aside}</code> is also available for some variety.</p>

<p>Kramdown, the Markdown parser used by this implementation of the Exocore, has the ability to apply a CSS class to a paragraph by including syntax like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.classname}</code> at the top or bottom of a paragraph. The class will be applied to the whole paragraph. The Exocore stylesheet includes a few general classes meant to be used for just this purpose, which you should feel free to add to.</p>

<p><strong>The following classes are pre-defined in the Exocore stylesheet:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.center}</code> ‚Äî <em>Reduces width of paragraph and centers it for emphasis</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.left-aside}</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.right-aside}</code> ‚Äî <em>Applies a border and floats to the left/right. Other text will wrap around it</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.left}</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.right}</code> - <em>Reduces width and places to the left/right (meant for images)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.border}</code> - <em>applies a thin border</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.shadow}</code> - <em>applies a dark blurred drop shadow</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.glow}</code> - <em>applies a bright blurred drop shadow (produces a glowing effect)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:.flip}</code> - <em>flips the image (or text) horizontally</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| You can           | create a          | simple table      | like this.     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| A new line        | in markdown       | extends the table | vertically.    |
| A pipe            | extends the table | laterally.        |                |
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>You can</th>
      <th>create a</th>
      <th>simple table</th>
      <th>like this.</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<p>For more options, check out the ‚Äòadvanced tables‚Äô plugin in the sidebar. This plugin will assist you with spacing and syntax, and includes a powerful formula function, about which you can find information <a href="https://github.com/tgrosinger/md-advanced-tables/blob/main/docs/formulas.md" class="web-link">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphviz">Graphviz</h2>

<p>For more complex data representation, <a href="https://graphviz.org/" class="web-link">Graphviz</a> can be used in conjunction with the Exocore. Read more about Graphviz syntax <a href="https://graphviz.org/documentation/" class="web-link">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sidenotes-and-footnotes">Sidenotes and Footnotes:</h2>

<p>Footnotes are done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[^1]</code>, and look like this: <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Each footnote is an anchor link to the bottom of the page, with a return link attached. Notice the sidenote in the right margin, identical to the footnote.</p>

<p>All footnotes are also rendered as sidenotes. A footnote forms a commentary or citation best kept separate from the main text, and a sidenote is an easy way for a reader to access such commentary without breaking ergonomy by jumping up and down the page.</p>

<p>If you want to add multi-paragraph footnotes, indent your second paragraph, like this (see footnote at bottom).<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[^2]: For longer footnotes, you may want to use multiple paragraphs.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can put a footnote‚Äôs markdown reference immediately under a paragraph, like this<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, or clump them at the end. Either way, they will appear at the bottom in your rendered content.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[^3]: This footnote appears immediately underneath its referring paragraph in this document's original markdown, but on the rendered website it shows at the bottom. </code></p>

<p>Footnotes automatically form a numbered list, and can also be mapped by name, like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[^named-footnote]</code><sup id="fnref:named-footnote" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:named-footnote" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="inserting-images">Inserting images</h2>

<p>To insert an image, use the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![](/images/flowers.png)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, <strong>don‚Äôt bother remembering this syntax.</strong> the easiest way to insert an image is to use the Paste Image VSCode extension, included in Obsidian by default, which you will be prompted to download as a recommended third-party extension of the Foam VSCode extension. For MacOS, copy your image to the clipboard, and use keyboard command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD + option + V</code>. You will be prompted to give your image file a name, and add it to the images folder in your Exocore‚Äôs top-level directory. <strong>Note:</strong> If you CMD+C copy an image from your desktop on a mac, it is not copied to your clipboard. Instead, open the image, and then use the same keyboard command.</p>

<p>You can insert alt text and a caption like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![This is alt text](/images/flowers.png)
*Insert a caption by placing italicised text immediately underneath the image*
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above snippet produces the below outcome:</p>

<p><img src="/images/flowers.png" alt="This is alt text">
<em>Insert a caption by placing italicised text immediately underneath the image, with no empty line in between.</em></p>

<h2 id="embedded-code">Embedded Code</h2>
<p>To embed a piece of code so that characters are rendered verbatim, surround the code snippet with ``` on either side, like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/zsh
cd ~/desktop/admin &amp;&amp; bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use just one ` to embed code in the same line as the rest of your text.</p>

<h2 id="naming-files">Naming files</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt use whitespace in your filenames‚Äî instead, name-them-like-this. This way, titles are easily converted to URLs and the back end of the Exocore remains happy. This of course applies only to filenames, and you may title your posts how you wish.</p>

<p>That should be everything to get you started!</p>
