# Circular Motion
An object that moves in a circle at a constant speed is said to be experiencing a uniform circular motion. The magnitude of the velocity is constant but the direction is changing.

As the direction changes, so too must velocity, as velocity is a measure of rate of displacement along a direction. Therefore, an object experiencing a uniform circular motion must also be experiencing a constant acceleration.

$$\vec{a_{average}} = \frac{\vec{v_{2}-\vec{v_{1}}}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$$



If we were to take an infinitesimal $\Delta t$, $\Delta \vec{v}$ approaches the center of the circle in direction.

For uniform circular motion, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are of the same magnitude, $v$.



$$\frac{\Delta v}{v} \approx \frac{l}{r} \therefore \Delta v \approx \frac{lv}{r}$$

If we return to our definition for acceleration:

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v}{r} \frac{l}{\Delta t} $$

$$\frac{l}{\Delta t} = v$$

$$\therefore a_{r} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

## Centripetal / Radial Acceleration

Therefore, in uniform circular motion, an object is constantly accelerating. The direction of this acceleration is towards the center of the circle, along $r$.

$$a_{r} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

$v$ is the linear velocity of the object. This velocity has a constant magnitude.

$r$ is the radius of the circular motion.

$a_{r}$ and $v$ are perpendicular.

### Additional Definitions

$T= Period$
The time it takes for an object to complete one circular revolution.

$f = frequency$
The number of revolutions an object completes per unit of time.

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

For uniform circular motion, the speed is constant. Therefore,

$$v = \frac{\text{circumference}}{T} = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
