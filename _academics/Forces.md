##  Friction

- #### Static Friction
	- The resistive force between an object and its environment when the object is *not moving* with respect to its environment
	- $\vec{f}_{s}$
	- static friction opposes the motion that the object would be going
	- $\vec{f_{s}} = \vec{F}_{applied}$
	- $$\vec{f}_{s}max = \mu_{s}F_{N}$$
	- $$\mu _{s} = \text{coefficient of friction}$$
- #### Kinetic Friction
	- Beyond the slipping point
	- Occurs when two objects are in contact and they are sliding with respect to each other
	- $\vec{f}{k}$ only has one value


$$\mu _{s} > \mu_{k}$$

$$f_{smax} > f_{k}$$

$\mu_{k}$ and $\mu _s$ are dimensionless  (i.e. they do not possess units). 

$f_{s}$ and $f_k$ are forced and can be measured in Newtons

$\mu_{k}$ and $\mu _s$ are nearly independent of the amount of area undergoing friction

$\mu_{k}$ is nearly independent of velocity
