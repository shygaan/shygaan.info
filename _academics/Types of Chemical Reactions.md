# Types of Chemical Reactions
## Combustion

- the "burning" of compounds in $\ce{O_{2(g)}}$

$$\ce {2C4H10{(g)} + 13O2 (g) -> 8CO2 (g) + 10H2O(l)}$$

Notes:
1. combustions of hydrocarbons *only* give $\ce{CO_2}$ and $\ce{H_2O}$
2. commonly used in compound identification


## Precipitation
- reactions that produce a [[Reactions in Aqueous Solutions#Sparingly Soluble Compounds|sparingly soluble]] product called a precipitate

$$\ce{NaCl(aq) + AgNO3 (aq) -> AgCl(s) + NaNO3 (aq)}$$

- called a ***molecular equation***; shown as molecules

$$\ce{Na+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) + Ag+ (aq) + NO3 - (aq) -> AgCl(s) + Na+ (aq) + NO3- (aq)}$$

- called an ***ionic equation***; shown as ions, if possible; more realistic

$$\ce {Cl- (aq) + Ag+ (aq) -> AgCl(s)}$$

- called a ***net ionic equation***; spectator ions cancelled

Notes:
1. we will discuss precipitation reactions in [[Reactions in Aqueous Solutions|aqueous media]] only
2. know the rules to identify which products are [[Reactions in Aqueous Solutions#Soluble Compounds|soluble]] and which are precipitates in water



## Acid / Base
- proton transfer reactions; transfer of $\ce{H+}$

$$\ce {HCl(aq) + NH3 (aq) -> NH4+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)}$$

BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry definition:
- acid ($\ce{HCl}$): proton donor
- base ($\ce{NH3}$): proton acceptor


- [[Reactions in Aqueous Solutions#1. Strong electrolytes:|Strong]] acids and bases: **completely** ionize in water
- [[Reactions in Aqueous Solutions#2. Weak electrolytes:|Weak]] acids and bases: **partially** ionize in water

Notes:
1. must know the common strong acids and bases in aqueous media; everything else is weak

## Redox

- electron transfer reactions

$$\ce{Cu(s) + 2AgNO3 (aq) -> 2Ag(s) + Cu(NO3)2 (aq)}$$

- convert to an ionic equation

$$\ce{Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO3- (aq) -> 2Ag(s) + Cu2+(aq) + 2NO3- (aq)}$$

- convert to a net ionic equation

$$\ce{Cu(s) + 2Ag+ (aq) -> 2Ag(s) + Cu2+(aq)}$$

- consider this process as two ***half-reactions***
	- $\ce{Cu(s) Cu2+(aq) + 2e-}$ involves the **loss** of $\ce{e-}$ : ***oxidation***
	- $\ce{2Ag+ (aq) + 2e- -> 2Ag(s)}$ involves the **gain** of $\ce{e-}$: reduction
