# Reactions in Aqueous Solutions


# General Properties of Aqueous Solutions
An aqueous solution is a mixture of a pure solid or liquid (i.e. *solute*) in water (i.e. *solvent*)

There are 3 types of solutes in water:
## 1. Strong electrolytes:
- conductive in water
- usually ionic
- ions [completely dissociate](#soluble-compounds)

$$\ce{ NaCl_{(s)} ->[{H_2O}] Na^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)} }$$

Note: single arrow indicates complete dissociation

## 2. Weak electrolytes:
- poorly conductive
- usually molecular
- ions [partially dissociate](#sparingly-soluble-compounds)

$$ \ce{CH_3CO_2H_{(aq)} <=>[{H_2O}] CH_3CO^-_2_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}}$$

Note: double arrow indicates reversible reaction, i.e. equilibrium

## 3. Non-electrolytes
- non-conductive
- always molecular
- dissolves but does not produce any ions

$$\ce{C12H22O11(s) ->[{H_2O}] C12H22O11(aq)}$$


# Solubility Rules for Common Ionic Compounds in Water
## Soluble Compounds
- Compounds of Alkali Metal Ions
	- $\ce{ Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+ }$
- Compounds of $\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$
- Nitrates ($\ce{ NO_{3}- }$)
- Acetates ($\ce{ C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}- }$)
- Chlorates ($\ce{ ClO_{3}- }$)
- Halides
	- $\ce{ Cl-, Br-, I- }$
	- **Exceptions:**
		- Halides of $\ce{ Ag+, Hg^2+, Pb^2+ }$
- Sulfates ($\ce{ SO_{4}^2- }$)
	- **Exceptions:**
		- Sulfates of $\ce{ Ag+, Ca^2+, Sr^2+, Ba^2+ Hg^2+, Pb^2+ }$



## Sparingly Soluble Compounds
- Carbonates ($\ce{ CO_{3}^2- }$), Phosphates ($\ce{ PO_{4}^3- }$), Chromates ($\ce{ CrO_{4}^2- }$)
	- **Exceptions:**
		- Compounds of alkali metal ions and $\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$
- Hydroxides ($\ce{ OH- }$), Sulfides ($\ce{ S^2- }$)
	- **Exceptions:**
		- Compounds of alkali metal ions and $\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$
		- Sulfides of alkaline earth metal ions
		- Hydroxides of $\ce{ Ba^2+ }$


# Precipitation Reactions
A common type of reaction seen occurring in aqueous solutions is *[[Types of Chemical Reactions#Precipitation|precipitation]]*, which results in the formation of a [sparingly soluble product](#sparingly-soluble-compounds), known as a **precipitate.**
