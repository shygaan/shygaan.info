### Development and Maintenance of Personal Information System [Zettelkasten]

This project has, thus far, been the culmination of my learning in Web Development and User Experience, drawing on my knowledge of interface design and full-stack development.

Along the way, I surmounted all manner of roadblocks: library incompatibility, almost unprecedented bugs, and my own limited knowledge of Ruby and Git. Countless hours were spent browsing the depths of niche tech forums and developer documentation, and several times I was forced to deviate heavily from my typical approach in order to solve a particularly difficult problem.

In the end, I am left with the fruit of my labour: a powerful tool that has served me immensely in my personal and academic lives, and will likely be a lifelong companion -- its effectiveness and abilities growing continuously alongside my own programming skills.

Key Features:
- Static site generator written in Ruby with integration of Liquid and SCSS, parsing easily legible plain-text Markdown and injecting contents into standard-compliant HTML pages
- Git integration allows for automatic deploying of notes to website upon changes to files
- Editor agnostic: files may be edited with any software and deployed all the same, with a simple Git push
- Online component acting as a website, fully-functional offline component is a filing system for any notes/written output
- Fully modular independent feature library
  - Image gallery, document viewer, graph visualization, tiling windows, aliasing syntax, daily note generation
-  Fully functional out of the box, no technical knowledge required:
   - can be customized without any technical knowledge, and with even a touch thereof it can be made into anything at all.


## Objective

<!-- I envision a world where personal agency is unrestricted and the flow of information is unimpeded by academic formalities and bureaucracy -- a return to the paradigm of the Old Internet, sandwiched between the dialectic infinities of self-interest and unsparing benevolence. Do not let talk of technology deceive you -- what I seek is not innovation; I am indifferent to the progression or even erasure of the Internet. Rather, I seek to cultivate the necessary principles to realize the highest purpose of all reason and intellect: the perception of Unadulterated Truth. The Internet is simply the greatest tool at my disposal. It is the agora of our age, a space where ideas converge and diverge, the concentrated collective human consciousness. My pursuit is driven by a vision to resurrect the ideals of the Old Internet and expand its civilized anarchy to the Real. To foster a culture conducive to Truth-seeking, by scientific, religious, or philosophical means.

The Internet and our material lives are reflections of one another: a change in one is a change in the other. I envision a kind of cultural, and by extension, digital [palingenisis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palingenesis) -- a New Internet paradigm, born of the dialectic infinities of unrelenting self-interest and unsparing benevolence.  The key to achieving this, I believe, is to revive the principles of the Old Internet: unrestricted user agency, free information, anonymity, and UNIX philosophy.


What I seek through my work is not technical innovation; I am indifferent to the progression or even total annihilation of technology. Rather, I seek the end goal of all reason and intellect, the highest purpose of the human Soul: the perception of Truth. In order to realize this, however, I believe that the Internet is the greatest tool at my disposal. It is the agora of our age, a space where ideas converge and diverge, shaping contours of our shared consciousness. The ideals of the Old Internet -- my pursuit is driven by a vision to resurrect these ideals in our contemporary cultural landscape and reclaim the Internet as a domain of potential and creativity.

As René Guénon said so wisely: 

All that we shall do or say will amount to giving those who come afterwards facilities which we ourselves were not given. Here as everywhere else it is the beginning of the work that is hardest.
