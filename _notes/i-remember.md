# I Remember




I remember when I was 16 and finally came of age in 2150 B.C. My friend Manishtushu and I went out to Urak by horse for three days. Then some guy named Naram-Sim was on a stage, and before performing, said "𒀭𒈾𒊏𒄠𒀭𒂗𒍪 𒈠𒀭𒅖𒌅𒋢𒊬𒊒𒄀", which really touched me. Then he sang a song. My friend, Manishtushu, was killed in battle. Those were the days.
