# Twelve Million?
The claim that the Arabic language boasts the largest lexicon, with an alleged 12 million words, is not only mathematically implausible but also reflects a misguided notion that a language's richness is measured solely by its word count. Let's deconstruct this assertion:

Mathematically speaking, the maximum number of permutations for a three-letter combination, given the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, is 21,952. For there to be 12 million words derived from 22,000 roots, each root would need to generate approximately 600 variations. However, Arabic does not have 22,000 roots, largely because many letter combinations are not viable.

### Restrictions on Root Combinations

1. No root consists of three identical consonants.
2. No root has identical first and second consonants.
3. Very few roots have identical first and third consonants.

Given these restrictions, the theoretical maximum number of three-letter roots is significantly lower. Moreover, the vast majority of these roots would lack any semantic value, further diminishing the potential word count. For example, the Hans Wehr dictionary of Classical Arabic lists only about 3,000 roots.

Sakhr Software, an Arabic language technology company, identifies roughly 10,000 roots (including those with more than three letters) and about 200,000 distinct words. Similarly, Lisān al-ʿArab by Ibn Manẓūr identifies 80,000 words and around 9,000 roots.

To achieve 12 million distinct words from 10,000 roots, each root would need to produce approximately 1,200 variations, a clearly implausible figure. Additionally, the definition of a "word" complicates this claim. If we consider all conjugations of a verb as a single word, the total word count would drop significantly. For instance, in English, "speaks," "speaking," and "spoke" are not usually considered separate words from "to speak."
