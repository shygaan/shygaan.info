# Where Is My Mind?
For the pronunciations of non-English symbols in this article, see: [[Transliteration|Transliteration Guide]].

Every consciousness burgeons into the world wholly unaware of its surroundings. It knows nothing of what exists, how they are, what it is itself, or what it even means to *be*. As it matures, it rapidly gathers and disseminates information about the world -- at first only that which is critical to its survival: how to obtain food, how to move through space, and so on.


The entirety of its existence is a small, inconsequential bubble. As the burgeoning mind increases in knowledge of the surrounding world, so does the world increase in complexity and problems. Its brain begins to combat this surplus of [[Predictive Processing and the Free Energy Principle|free energy]] by streamlining the process of discovery. It ignores an increasing amount of familiar and inconsequential stimuli, relying on predictions based on its constructed reality.

The realization sets in that things *are*, and, for the most part, always will be. It is also around this time that the young mind learns of the expectations and standards it must meet. The concept of other minds, inconceivably larger than its own, emerges.

For the first time, it is made aware of competition: that others like itself exist, and that these peers are not as welcoming or supportive as those with whom it has thus far been acquainted, such as its mother or father. Most of them are competing to impose their presence upon the very same space. Still, time runs like honey in a jar, as each day is filled with intense novelty.


As the mind matures, it becomes saturated with millions, if not billions, of ideas and memories. The mind is told that its only value is in its ability to assume the shape of a mold, forced through by the weight of millennia of tradition and the legacy of the dead.

Its new form is geometric, uniform, and efficient. The drawback of this transformation, however, is that it now drifts through each day with a preconceived notion of life, expecting it to be as it always has been. And now, it is always as it always has been, for the mind is the constructor of its reality. Society has successfully sealed it into a box -- and a very important thing happens.


This new mind realizes that it was never the center of the story. It was created from nothing, then placed into an incomprehensibly large [[burhaan#The Jumla|aggregate]]. The universe did not so much as blink at its conception -- it has existed since time immemorial and will persist long after this mind withers away.


The illusions of its infancy now seem muted and grey -- dead, lifeless, cold. The curiosity that, in its youth, made it marvel at the tiniest of details, is shattered. As these childhood wonders fade, the very mechanisms of perception begin to change.


It ceases to truly see or feel. It predicts, it categorizes, and it discards. The mind, once alive, becomes mechanical. There is no debasement more crude than an incorporeal soul reduced to flesh and electrical impulses.


The mind now feels purposeless -- it moved from a period of discovery to one of action, and quickly learned that within the small domain of childhood, it was omnipotent. Now realizing its weakness, it weeps, for in the true scope and scale of the universe, it is impotent.

A million years into our history, those who find themselves surviving this epoch are nearly incapable of even exiting their bed in the morning; only perhaps to drag themselves through the mundanity of life and relive each day as the one before.

It is a test of the mind to come to grips with the burgeoning complexity and tedium of its new reality, and to establish a new base of awe, effectively: it must find a self-validated reason to continue existing.<!--[^1]--> In childhood, this was easy. Each day was novel and exciting. It found purpose in the simple act of living, for it had not yet discovered life.


This is where the overwhelming majority fail. Most seek purpose<!--[^2]--> through regression: attempting to recreate the wonder of childhood, to build pharmaceutical and virtual facsimiles of that original state. But consciousness cannot contract once expanded. The mind, having tasted the fruit of awareness, cannot return to its original garden.

Here we find the great paradox: the very reductionism that drained the world of wonder has revealed layers of enigma more profound than ever imagined.

Resolution lies in the impossible arithmetic of consciousness: that as understanding deepens, so too does mystery. Each question answered births ten more profound than the first. Each equation solved reveals new variables unknown.

The mature mind does not marvel at a butterfly, but at its exit from the cocoon -- at how simple rules birth complexity; at how meaning crystallizes from chaos at the hands of the Assembler [[[names-of-allaah|al-Jāmiʿ]]\]; at how the mind itself was fashioned from naught by the Bestower of Form [[[names-of-allaah|al-Muṣawwir]]\]. It neither retreats into childlike wonder nor resigns itself to mechanical determinism, but maintains itself in tension with the Unmanifest [[[names-of-allaah|al-Bāṭin]]\] -- forever poised in the zero-point between being and becoming, between the finite and infinite, between the expressible and the ineffable.

This is not spirituality as escape, but as confrontation with the ultimate problems of existence. The Divine reveals itself precisely in the mechanics we thought had killed it: in the entropy that births order, in the quantum foam that underlies reality, in the emergent properties that allow flesh and electricity to contemplate itself.

Only in embracing our uncertainty and surrending to the vastness that both transcends and constitutes us, do we find our surest footing. The Truth [[[names-of-allaah|al-Ḥaqq]]\] reveals itself not as a destination but as the journey -- an eternal process of dissolution and synthesis, dancing between the infinite depths of reality.

<!-- The consciousness now finds itself suspended in a trialectic of infinities: the boundless complexity of the physical universe, the fathomless depths of experience, and the interminable horizon of knowledge to be gained. Each discovery illuminates virgin territories of ignorance; each answer raises more insoluble questions.

 [^1]: In truth, there is an infinite world at which we may marvel but that we ignore. Even our concrete jungles are the physical manifestation of humanity's collective effort - marks left by the double-edged sword of technological "advancement". Glass towers chase the sun - a display of our Icarian ambition - while a syringe discarded on the pavement reveals the Faustian nature of that same drive. Even the junky on the corner gives us something to contemplate: our modern human condition. Just as our own brain, seeking security, cripples and constrains itself, we have discarded God and attempted to fill his role - thereby inflicting our own damnation and believing it ascension into divinity.


 [^1]: Not to discover the world, but to discover "theirself". *The self, the self, the self* -- what is this "self" in which they believe so fervently? It is surely not through gluttonous consumption and material comfort that the "self" is discovered. Nay, the self must be forged, wrought from flesh and bone and blood and soul in the crucible of the heart. But this is to be explained in depth in a future post.


So, dear reader, I leave you with a deeply personal question. What, to you, is more noble: to fly towards the sun and be enkindled in a swift blaze of glory, or to remain on the ground but incandesce with a solar passion forevermore?

 So let the mind ponder the world over which its Lord has given it dominion. Let each pigeon perched upon a line and He in whose feathers lie memories of cliffsides and alpine gales, becomes but a pigeon perched upon a line. That blinding light, whence an iridescence that fills the sky, becomes a nuisance that serves only to make it sweat.-->
