# The Proof of the Truthful
For the pronunciations of non-English symbols in this article, see: [[Transliteration|Transliteration Guide]].


The Proof of the Truthful [برهان الصديقين] is a theological argument for the existence of God, first introduced by Avicenna [Ibn Sīnā]. The fundamental principle of the Proof of the Truthful is the distinction between essence - what is, and existence - how it is.


A thing’s essence is that which it cannot lack without ceasing to be what it is. It distinguishes between the various things that exist in the universe, eg. the essence of a cat differs from that of a human being. But essence is not the same as existence, as one cannot infer that a thing exists simply because one knows what it is. Infinite constructs can be imaged in the mind without existing in reality.

## Modes of Essence

Avicenna defined 3 modes of essence with regard to existence:

1. An impossible being’s essence precludes its existence. A triangle has 3 sides in essence, and thus a 4-sided triangle cannot exist without ceasing to be a triangle.


2. A contingent being’s existence is dependent on that of something else. When the contingent is the cause of another contingent being, it becomes «necessary» with respect to what it has caused. Everything in the cosmos is contingent according to Avicenna.

    Given that a contingent being’s existence must be caused by another being, if a contingent being is caused by another and so on and so forth, there must be a necessary existent or one falls into an infinite regress of causality, though Avicenna’s argument does not necessarily preclude this idea.


3. The necessary existence is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic nature, and from the necessary springs forth the rest of existence. Thus it exists by necessity, ie. it cannot _not_ exist.

## The Jumla

Avicenna argued that the jumla [جُملة] - the aggregate of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, and will exist - must have an external force that causes it to exist, and īs thus itself contingent as well. This cause cannot be a contingent existent, or it would already be included within the jumla. Therefore, the external cause must be necessary.

He did anticipate objection, based on the idea that the jumla may not be contingent itself, as a whole does not automatically inherit the attributes of its parts. A set of numbers, for example, is not itself a number. The objection thus states that assuming the contingency of a collection of contingents is wrong.

Avicenna considered this an admission of defeat rather than an objection in fact, as if the aggregate of contigents is not contingent, then it must be necessary. Thus there is indeed a necessary existent, the proof of which is the whole purpose of his argument.

Side note: if an infinite causality is true, but is set in motion by extra-temporal/spatial process, this process would also be a necessary existent and thus the argument is proven again.

## Is it God?

Now that the necessary existent has been established, we can move on to the next part of the argument: How do we identify the necessary existent as God?

An athiest may agree that the necessary existent is real, but it could be cosmos itself, or there could be many, none of which is God. Avicenna was aware of this limitation in his argument, and responded using a reductio [proof by contradiction]. According to him, there cannot be multiple necessary existents. If one postulates the existence of two necessary being, A and B, Avicenna considers two possible outcomes:

1. If A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from its necessity, then B would also share this attribute [being a necessary existent as well], so they are not distinct after all.

2. If, on the other hand, A’s distinction is not an implication of its necessity, then this individuating factor is caused, meaning that A has a cause, and is not necessary after all.


Avicenna also argues that the necessary existent must not be a composite. If it were composite, its constituent parts must have features that individuate one from another.

These individuating factor cannot be derived solely from necessity, as then they would all possess said attribute, and, as a result, not be distinct. However, it cannot be accidental or requiring outside cause either, as this would contradict its necessity of existence.

<!-- ## Critiques

As powerful as it, there is a glaring problem in the Proof of the Truthful.
Avicenna believed that God cannot have features or relations that are contingent, so he posits that, since God is necessary, His causing of the universe must also be necessary, because it is an expression of His necessity.

As stated by al-Ghazzālī in a response to the argument, this contradicts the Islamic belief in Allāh’s boundless free will, as it implies that His will is constrained by a requirement to create the universe.

Unfortunately, this rejection of Allāh’s free will is the reason for which the majority of scholars [myself as well, though I am not a scholar] are compelled to label him a kāfir [infidel]. Any rejection of one of Allāh’s attributes is a major heresy which takes one out of the fold of Islām through apostasy. -->
