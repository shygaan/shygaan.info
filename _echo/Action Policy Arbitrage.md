## 1. Preamble
**A**. The state of a person’s life is the result of an accumulation of decisions.

**B**. The decisions that a person makes form a pattern.

**C**. From this pattern it is possible to derive an emergent policy of action (**Action Policy**).

**D**. An **Action Policy** is the ruleset by which actions are generated from beliefs about the person’s environment: *“Given X facts, make Y action”*.

**E**. Notionally, an **Action Policy** is an algorithm for decision-making given incomplete knowledge about an environment (ie. an **Action Policy** is as an approximate algorithmic solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process).


## 2. Passive Amendment to the Action Policy

**A**. An **Action Policy** is subconsciously and continuously revised and updated through:

1. Learning

2. Divine Experience.

3. Trauma

**B**. In general, revisions to the **Action Policy** stimulated by **Learning** and **Divine Experience** are edifying, and lead to greater **Agency** and **Victory**, while revisions resulting from **Trauma** are regressive, leading to risk-aversion and **Failure**.

1. The shrewd pupil is wary of **Trauma** disguised as **Learning**.

2. The pupil also acknowledges that **Divine Experience** may be traumatic, but still be edifying.

3. The pupil knows that **Unbeautiful Experience** is traumatic

**C**. All non-divine experience is metabolised as either **Learning** or **Trauma**, or it is **Forgotten**.

## 3. Effortful Amendment to the Action Policy
**A**. An **Action Policy** can also be updated effortfully, through **Discipline**.

**B**. **Discipline** competes with the **Inertia of an Action Policy**, which leaves it resistant to change. The prospect of **Disciplinary Victory** over **Action Policy Inertia** increases and decreases as a function of its cumulative past victories over **Inertia**, adjusted for recency.
1. Alternately phrased, like begets like exponentially, and the effect size of **Discipline** is therefore causally circular, either entropically or negentropically.

2. Prolonged negative emotion, malaise, and powerlessness are the result of continued **Indulgence**, concessions to **Inertia**, and autocatalytic downturn in **Agency** stimulated by **Failure** and **Defeat**

## 4. The Belief State

**A**. The **Belief State** is a predictive model of a person’s environment, and is coterminous with a person’s beliefs and presumptions about the state of their environment.

**B**. Implicit in, and derivable from, the **Belief State**, are accurate or inaccurate **Predictions**, which are anticipatory fantasies about the experiences expected to follow from **Actions**.

1. The shrewd pupil will understand that the only available input to measure the accuracy of a prediction is the resulting experiences from actions taken on them. Predictions anticipate the **Perceived Result**, which the pupil must not mistake for the **Real Result**.
2. The accuracy of a prediction is measured by the extent of **Victory** achieved as a result of acting upon the prediction. **Total Victory** is achieved by acting on totally accurate predictions. Properly conceived, **Victory** is the sole measure of the accuracy of a prediction, and of the appropriateness of the **Belief State**.
3. Improperly conceived, predictions are accurate to the extent of their correlation with the phantasmic ‘reality’, and unrelated to **Victory**. This conception is improper because it is circular: the phantasmic ‘reality’ is actually the **Belief State** in disguise, an internal and mutable phenomenon mistaken for an external and static one.

**C**. Notionally, the **Real Result** is comprised of the **Perceived Result**, reduced in proportion to **Misattributed Causality**, and increased in proportion to the **Unperceived Results**.

   1. *(PR - MR) + UR*

**D.** The **Belief State** is parsimoniously updated as a function of the **Prediction Delta**, a measurement of the difference between the **Prediction** and the **Perceived Outcome** based on discrete inferences of causal relation.

E. The **State Transition Function** is the function by which the **Belief State** is amended, and resists amendment. The evolution of the **Belief State** is determined by the **State Transition Function**.

## 5. Action Policy Arbitrage


**A**. Notionally, the **Belief State** can be directly amended effortfully through **Discipline**, if the pupil is in a state of **Ultimate Agency**. Most pupils will never achieve true discipline, let alone **Ultimate Agency**.

**B**. Through **Shrewd Interrogation**, it is possible to backwards-engineer the priors of another person’s **Action Policy**.

**C**. Through **Comparative Evaluation**, it is possible to identify the inferiorities of one’s own **Action Policy**, and the corresponding priors which underlie the inferiorities.

**D**. The process of amending the **Action Policy** is **Action Policy Arbitrage**.

## The Pupil has Learned:
1. All non-divine experience is metabolised as either **Learning** or **Trauma**, or it is **Forgotten**.

2. The pupil’s **Perceived Result** is easily mistaken for the **Real Result**.

3. The phantasmic ‘reality’ is actually the pupil’s **Belief State**.

4. **Total Victory** is the final measure of the accuracy of **Predictions** and **Beliefs**.

5. **Ultimate Agency** is required to force amendments to the **Belief State**.

6. Thusly, **Ultimate Agency** materialises **TOTAL VICTORY**.

## Thusly the Pupil May Make Himself Holy:
1. Observing the **Belief State** and **Action Policy** of others
2. Amending his own **Action Policy** through **Discipline** and **Action Policy Arbitrage**
3. Controlling, limiting, or metabolising **Unbeautiful Experience**
4. Increasing openness to **Divine Experience** and devoting himself to **Learning**
5. Directly amending the **Belief State** to achieve **Total Victory**
