[2:23 AM]
- Wow

[2:24 AM]
- Can u feel it
- There’s something weird about today
- Why does this day feel better than yesterday

[3:22 AM]
- Because, [REDACTED],
- Today marks the beginning of our struggle.



The air hums with energy, electrifying the nerves. The heart's thundering beat swells the muscles with a bellicose ichor. Rushing synapses stir reminders of battle immemorial, buried deep in the genome of the soul.

The fist tightens around the hilt of a sword not yet forged. The fingers twitch, as if to fire a bow not yet strung. The mind dreams the scent of smoke and the sound of a distant cry. From bared teeth drips the Blood of a man not yet born.

In the growl of engines a snorting cavalry can be heard. 
Ahead, we chase our fate into that distant morrow, until we grasp destiny in the palm of our hands. A Great War looms over the horizon of Divine Decree, and only those with Faith will survive. Perhaps not in our lifetimes, but preparation is a virtuous pursuit nonetheless.
