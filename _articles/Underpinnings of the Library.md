# Underpinnings of the Library

## Digitally-Integrated Mind Palace
- Navigability
  - Easy hyperlinking = frequent hyperlinking
- Memorability
  - Hijacking and piggybacking on existing human mnemonic faculties
    - [[Underpinnings of the Library#Chernoff Faces|Chernoff Faces]]
    - [[Underpinnings of the Library#Urbit Sigils|Urbit Sigils]]
    - [[Underpinnings of the Library#Urbit Names|Urbit Names]]
    - Spatial faculties — does an implementation exist?
  - Zettelkasten mnemonic badges

## Semantic Internet
- Plain text
  - Accessibility
  - Universality
- Standards-compliance
- Portability
- Static Website Delivery

## Writing as Thinking, Written Output as Consolidated Thought
 - Feynman Technique
 - General —> specific, scattered -> polished

## Data Ownership and Escaping Net Serfdom
- Digital owned space
  - Customisability
  - Local Instance
  - Digital and Personal Legacy

## FOSS
- The Viral Public License
- Non-proprietary (open source) file formats

## Network Sublimation
- Collaboration
- Webrings
- RSS
- Remchat
- The New Internet

## Frictionlessness
- Local storage
- No internet required
- No coding required
- Searchability — in contention with static design

## Tradition of the Library
- The Roman Room
- The Memex
- The Zettelkasten
- Project Xanadu
- Web 1.0
- IRC
- Webrings
- Digital Gardens

## Related Concepts and Projects:
- Project Xanadu
- Memex
- Compendium
- Zettelkasten

## Visual data representations that piggyback on human mnemonic faculties
### Chernoff Faces
![](/images/chernoff-faces.png)

  > "Chernoff faces, invented by applied mathematician, statistician and physicist Herman Chernoff in 1973, display multivariate data in the shape of a human face. The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation."

# The Lukasa

![](/images/lukasa.jpg)
> "Court historians known as bana balute ("men of memory") run their fingertips across the surface of a lukasa or point to its features while reciting genealogies, king lists, maps of protocol, migration stories, and the great Luba Epic, a preeminent oral narrative that records how the culture heroes, Mbidi Kiluwe and his son Kalala Ilunga, introduced royal political practices and etiquette.
